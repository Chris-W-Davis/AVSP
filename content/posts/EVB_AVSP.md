Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson and the Birth of AVSP

Eight years after Barbara Dodd and Ruth Campbell’s Hearing by Eye (1987)[1], “the first edited book on the psychology of lip-reading”[2], the NATO Advanced Studies Institute (ASI) Workshop, Speechreading by Man and Machine[3] was held at the Chateau de Bonas, Castera-Verduzan, France. This two-week meeting was the first interdisciplinary meeting devoted to the subject of speechreading. It was a one of a kind. And it sowed the seeds for AVSP research to come. Forty-five researchers (from twelve countries), whose work covered topics such as human perception and cognition, linguistics, neuroscience, computer animation, machine learning and computer vision, held forth in a never-to-be-repeated cavalcade of science show and tell. What follows is first an episodic account of scenes from the meeting, that begins with the author’s initial encounter with Eric, from which the story shifts to the formation of the Audio-Visual Speech Association (AVISA), the establishment of the AVSP conferences, and the role that Eric played therein, and finally, it traces a few outlines of the bigger picture of Eric’s impact on AVSP.
